# PHRM-Diag Test Scripts

This directory contains basic test scripts for the MVP functionality.

## Running Tests

For now, we have basic manual testing procedures. In the future, we'll implement automated tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Manual Test Procedures

### 1. Authentication Tests
- [ ] User can register with email/password
- [ ] User can login with valid credentials
- [ ] User cannot login with invalid credentials
- [ ] User session persists after page refresh

## Automated Tests (Future)

We plan to implement automated tests using:
- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests
- Supertest for API tests

## Performance Tests

Basic performance checks:
- [ ] Initial page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] File upload handling for large files
- [ ] Memory usage during heavy operations
