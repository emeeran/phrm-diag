# Module 6 (Week 15) - OCR Integration and Document Processing

## Implementation Summary

In Week 15 of the PHRM-Diag project, we successfully implemented OCR integration and intelligent document processing capabilities. These features enable the application to automatically extract, process, and categorize information from various medical documents such as lab results, prescriptions, medical reports, and more.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. OCR Service Integration (`ocr.py`)
- Integrated Tesseract OCR for local document processing
- Created flexible architecture supporting both local and future cloud OCR providers
- Implemented preprocessing for improved OCR accuracy
- Built support for various document formats (PDF, images)
- Added text extraction optimizations for medical documents

### 2. Smart Document Categorization (`categorization.py`)
- Developed automatic document classification for 10+ medical document types
- Created medical terminology extraction for various categories (lab tests, medications, etc.)
- Implemented date extraction with context analysis
- Built numeric value extraction with units and reference ranges
- Added duplicate document detection using TF-IDF and cosine similarity

### 3. Document Processing API (`api.py`)
- Created FastAPI-based service for document processing
- Implemented background processing for handling large documents
- Added status tracking for long-running OCR tasks
- Built comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Created health check endpoints for monitoring

### 4. Testing Tools (`test_processing.py`)
- Developed test utilities for OCR and categorization
- Created sample document generation for testing
- Implemented full pipeline tests

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **Tesseract OCR**: Open-source OCR engine
- **OpenCV**: Image preprocessing for improved OCR quality
- **PDF2Image**: PDF to image conversion for OCR processing
- **FastAPI**: Modern API framework for Python
- **scikit-learn**: For TF-IDF vectorization and similarity measures
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for running the API

### Architecture
The document processing module follows a service-oriented architecture:

1. **Client Layer**: API endpoints for document submission and status checking
2. **Processing Layer**: 
   - OCR Service for text extraction
   - Document Categorizer for intelligent analysis
3. **Storage Layer**: Currently in-memory (to be replaced with database integration)

### Performance Considerations
- Background processing for handling large documents
- Image preprocessing to optimize OCR accuracy
- Efficient TF-IDF vectorization for document similarity

## Integration with PHRM-Diag

This module integrates with the main PHRM-Diag application to provide:

1. Automatic extraction of health data from uploaded documents
2. Smart categorization and filing of medical records
3. Extraction of key medical values for analytics
4. Detection of duplicate documents
5. Enhanced search through extracted text and metadata

## Next Steps (Week 16)

1. **AI-Enhanced Processing**
   - Medical report summarization
   - Key findings extraction
   - Trend identification from documents
   - Cross-reference with existing records

2. **Document Management**
   - Version control for documents
   - Document sharing with family
   - Annotation and note-taking
   - Document search and indexing

## Usage Instructions

### Starting the Document Processing Service
```bash
python main.py --mode api --port 8000
```

### Processing Documents via API
**Endpoint:** `POST /process-document`
**Checking Status:** `GET /document-status/{document_id}`

### Command Line Processing
```bash
python main.py --mode cli --file path/to/document.pdf --output results.json
```

## Testing
Run the test suite to verify functionality:
```bash
python document_processing/test_processing.py --full
```
