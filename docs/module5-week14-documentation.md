- **POST /api/predictive**: Generate new predictive insights by type (risks, recommendations, appointments, preventive care)
- **PUT /api/predictive/:id**: Mark a predictive insight as read
- **GET /api/predictive/:id**: Fetch a specific predictive insight
- **DELETE /api/predictive/:id**: Delete a specific predictive insight

#### Smart Alerts API
- **GET /api/alerts**: Fetch all health alerts for the current user
- **POST /api/alerts**: Generate new alerts by type (anomaly, refill, milestone, wellness)
- **PUT /api/alerts/:id**: Dismiss or update an alert
- **GET /api/alerts/:id**: Fetch a specific alert
- **DELETE /api/alerts/:id**: Delete a specific alert
